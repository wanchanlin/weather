# 🌍 Mars V.S. Earth 🪐

## Project Overview

**Mars V.S. Earth** is a web application that compares real-time weather conditions on Earth and Mars. By fetching data from both OpenWeatherMap and NASA's InSight APIs, the app helps users determine whether they're eligible or prepared to "move" to Mars based on environmental comparisons and additional custom conditions.
